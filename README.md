Accompanist is a group of libraries that aim to supplement [Jetpack Compose][compose] with features that are commonly required by developers but not yet available.

Accompanist is a labs like environment for new Compose APIs. We use it to help fill known gaps in the Compose toolkit, experiment with new APIs and to gather insight into the development experience of developing a Compose library. The goal of these libraries is to upstream them into the official toolkit, at which point they will be deprecated and removed from Accompanist.

For more details like, why does this library exist? Why is it not part of AndroidX? Will you be releasing more libraries? Check out our [Accompanist FAQ](https://medium.com/p/b55117b02712).

## Compose versions

Each [release](https://github.com/google/accompanist/releases) outlines what version of the Compose UI libraries it depends on. We are currently releasing multiple versions of Accompanist for the different versions of Compose:

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Compose 1.0 (1.0.x)</td><td><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.accompanist/accompanist-permissions?versionPrefix=0.20"></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Compose 1.1 (1.1.x)</td><td><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.accompanist/accompanist-permissions?versionPrefix=0.23"></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Compose UI 1.2 (1.2.x)</td><td><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.accompanist/accompanist-permissions?versionPrefix=0.25"></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Compose UI 1.3 (1.3.x)</td><td><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.accompanist/accompanist-permissions?versionPrefix=0.28"></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Compose UI 1.4 (1.4.x)</td><td><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.accompanist/accompanist-permissions?versionPrefix=0.30"></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Compose UI 1.5 (1.5.x)</td><td><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.accompanist/accompanist-permissions?versionPrefix=0.32"></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Compose UI 1.6 (1.6.x)</td><td><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.accompanist/accompanist-permissions?versionPrefix=0.34"></td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Compose UI 1.7 (1.7.x)</td><td><img alt="Maven Central" src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.google.accompanist/accompanist-permissions"></td>
 </tr>
</table>

For stable versions of Compose, we use the latest *stable* version of the Compose compiler. For non-stable versions (alpha, beta, etc), we use the latest compiler at the time of release.

> :warning: **Ensure you are using the Accompanist version that matches with your Compose UI version**: If you upgrade Accompanist, it will upgrade your Compose libraries version via transitive dependencies.

## Libraries

### üåè [Web](./web/)
A wrapper around WebView for basic WebView support in Jetpack Compose.

---

## Future?

Any of the features available in this group of libraries may become obsolete in the future, at which point they will (probably) become deprecated. 

We will aim to provide a migration path (where possible), to whatever supersedes the functionality.

## Snapshots

Snapshots of the current development version of Accompanist are available, which track the latest commit. See [here](docs/using-snapshot-version.md) for more information.

### Why the name?

The library is all about adding some utilities around Compose. Music composing is done by a
composer, and since this library is about supporting composition, the supporting role of an [accompanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accompaniment) felt like a good name.
